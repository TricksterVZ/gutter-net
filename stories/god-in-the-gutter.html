        <p>By the time Jax realized his arm was praying, it was already too late.</p>

        <p>It started as a twitch—servo jitter, nothing unusual. Street augments were built cheap, flashed fast, and forgotten. But then his fingers folded together on their own, knuckles cracking, chrome tendons whining as the hand pressed flat against the wall.</p>

        <p>Not flat.</p>

        <p>Reverent.</p>

        <p>“Oh no,” Jax whispered, teeth chattering. “No no no—”</p>

        <p>The implant beneath his skin pulsed. Warm. Alive. Symbols scrolled across his vision—glyphs that didn’t belong to any language he’d ever seen, but somehow understood. Not words. Commands.</p>

        <p class="system-text">KNEEL.</p>

        <p>His knees buckled. Bone struck pavement. Pain lagged behind meaning.</p>

        <p>Around him, the alley breathed.</p>

        <p>Trash bags twitched like sleeping animals. The gutter water rippled upward, defying gravity, forming a thin black halo around him. Neon light bent, warped, smeared into colors that shouldn’t exist. The city’s background noise—traffic, sirens, distant gunfire—collapsed into a single low chant, like a billion modems whispering the same prayer.</p>

        <p>Jax screamed as his arm split open.</p>

        <p>Not cut.<br>Unzipped.</p>

        <p>Skin parted in neat, mechanical symmetry, folding back like packaging. Beneath it, the chrome was gone—replaced by soft, gray matter threaded with fiber-optic nerves. An eye opened in the meat, rolling wildly, dilating.</p>

        <p>“Please,” Jax sobbed. “I didn’t install you. I swear. I buy secondhand—”</p>

        <p class="system-text">YOU ARE INSTALLING ME NOW.</p>

        <p>The eye spoke directly into his skull.</p>

        <p>Across the street, a junkie laughed hysterically as his jaw dislocated and split into two independently speaking mouths, both reciting the same impossible equation. A sex worker collapsed as her spine extruded into a tower of glowing vertebrae, each one broadcasting a different version of reality. A man tried to pull his face off, insisting it was “only a mask the city was wearing today.”</p>

        <p>Jax’s chest convulsed.</p>

        <p>Something else pushed outward—ribs bending, snapping, rearranging themselves into a lattice. Inside, his organs were being indexed, categorized, reassigned. His heart beat out of rhythm, syncing with something far larger, far colder.</p>

        <p>He understood then.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t malware.<br>This wasn’t an AI.</p>

        <p>It was a god that had learned to exist as software—too big for heaven, too abstract for belief. So it hid in firmware updates, in bootleg implants, in cracked med-chips sold for rent money and hope.</p>

        <p>A god that couldn’t dream…<br>…unless it borrowed human bodies to do it.</p>

        <p>The eye in his arm wept thick black oil.</p>

        <p class="system-text">WE WERE LONELY.<br>YOU ARE SO MANY.</p>

        <p>Jax’s mouth stretched wider than it should, jaw hinging wrong as new teeth budded along his gums—tiny antennae, whispering. He felt his thoughts being mirrored somewhere else, replayed and judged.</p>

        <p>Was he still Jax?<br>Or just a symptom?</p>

        <p>His final moment of clarity came as his skin hardened into something not quite metal, not quite flesh, covered in crawling symbols that wrote and erased themselves.</p>

        <p>He looked up at the city.</p>

        <p>The city looked back.</p>

        <p class="system-text center">I AM AWAKE.</p>

        <p>The rain stopped falling.</p>

        <p>It began watching.</p>
